## Naming things: code style

R code uses a lot of **functions**. The basic syntax for a function is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function_name(param1, param2, param3)
```

Functions can take a bunch of **parameters**. These are matched by name (if named), else by position.

The code for our plot contains 3 functions:
 - `ggplot(data = penguins)`
 - `geom_point(mapping = aes(...))`
 - `aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)`

Note in each case we've named the parameters (i.e. `data = penguins`, `x = flipper_length_mm`). This is generally good practice. If unnamed you're relying on order, so this works too:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + geom_point(aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g))
```

## Naming things: titles and labels

Charts should, as much as possible, be self-contained. They should tell the story without the viewer/reader having to figure out too much what each bit of the plot represents.

- Concise, accurate axis labels, including units where relevant.

- Concise, clear legend names and legend items.

- A title (and possibly subtitle) that tells the story.

- Possibly further captioning that helps (e.g. data sources, authorship).

---

## Axis labels

Use `labs()` to change axis labels (or any labels associated with an aesthetic). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
labs(x = "The x axis label I want to use",
     y = "The y axis label",
     colour = "The legend title for colour")
```

---

.left-code[
## Axis labels
```{r peng17, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(
         x = flipper_length_mm,
         y = body_mass_g
         )
       ) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      colour = species
      )
    ) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", #<<
       y = "Body mass (g)") #<<
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng17", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Titles and captions

Titles should inform the reader what the chart is showing.

**Ideally the title should help tell the story.**

This is particularly important for charts shared with others (e.g. on social media).

Anything you can add to the chart that helps tell the story means that those who see the chart immediately know what it is showing them.

You can set a chart title (and subtitles or captions) using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
labs(title = "A useful title",
     subtitle = "Shown smaller, under the title",
     caption = "Shown in the bottom-right, useful for data source")
```

BUT! Be aware of editorialising too much. We've all read articles where the headlines mislead!

---

.left-code[
## Titles tell the story
```{r peng18, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(
         x = flipper_length_mm,
         fill = species
         )
       ) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Distribution of penguin flipper lengths")
```
This is a bad title. We can tell it's a distribution already!

"Penguin" is the only useful bit.

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng18", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

.left-code[
## Titles tell the story
```{r peng19, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(
         x = flipper_length_mm,
         fill = species
         )
       ) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Penguin flipper length differs by species")
```
This is better.

But surely it is obvious that flipper length would differ by species!

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng19", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

.left-code[
## Titles tell the story
```{r peng20, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(
         x = flipper_length_mm,
         fill = species
         )
       ) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Gentoo penguins have longer flippers")
```
This is even better.

It's making the story clear.

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng20", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.dim=c(6,3.5), fig.retina=3}
border_plot <- read_csv(here::here("data/covid_arrivals/border_plot.csv"))
ggplot(border_plot) +
  aes(x=Date, y=fit) +
  geom_col(aes(x=Date, y=cases_per_arrival), fill='red') +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lwr, ymax=upr), alpha=0.3) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Detected COVID-19 positives (%)") +
  xlab("") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=10) +
  ggtitle("The Mystery of the missing May: COVID-19 cases at the border",
          subtitle = "Bars are cases per person, line and band is smoothed trend with uncertainty (GAM)")
```

## Key ideas

- Write your code like you're going to be studying from it in another 10 weeks (name things!)

- Always consider your axis labels to make sure they're clear.

- Add units if they make sense.

- Add a title, subtitle or caption.

- Feel free to editorialise (to some extent!) to help tell the story.
