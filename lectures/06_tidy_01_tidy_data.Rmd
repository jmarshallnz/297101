## Tidy data

Consider the following data on COVID-19 case and testing numbers from New Zealand and Australia in 2020.

```{r, message=FALSE}
covid1 <- read_csv("http://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/covid_au_nz.csv")
covid1
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
covid2 <- read_csv("http://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/covid_au_nz2.csv")

## Tidy data

All of these cases represent the exact same values on the four variables of `country`, `month`, `cases` and `tests` but
each arrange it differently.

- `covid1` has each of these as separate columns.

- `covid2` has a `type` and `count` column combining `cases` and `tests`.

- `covid3` has the `cases` and `tests` columns combined into a `rate` (cases per test) variable.

- `covid4a` and `covid4b` has the cases and tests data separate, and has separate columns for each country.

One of these, the **tidy** dataset, will be much easier to work with than the others, particularly when using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` (i.e. the `tidyverse`).

---

## Tidy data rules

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

1. Each variable should be a column.

2. Each observation should be a row.

3. Each value should have its own cell.

</div>

## Tidy data

In the previous examples, only `covid1` is tidy, as it's the only example where each
column is a variable.

`covid2` has variable names in rows (in the `type` column), which means observations are scattered across more than one row.

`covid3` has two separate variables in a single column (the `rate` column).

`covid4a` and `covid4b` has a variable spread over two columns (the country columns) where column names represent values.

--

**The key is to identify what are the variables, and what are observations?**

---

## Tidy data is easy to work with

Compute cases as a percentage of tests:

```{r}
covid1 |> mutate(rate = cases/tests * 100)
```

---

## Tidy data is easy to work with

Total cases and tests per country

```{r}
covid1 |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarise(cases = sum(cases),
            tests = sum(tests))
```

## Two common problems

Data in the real world is often not tidy.

Often it suffers from one of two problems:

- A variable might be spread across multiple columns (e.g. `covid4a` and `covid4b`)

- Observations may be spread across multiple rows (e.g. `covid2`).

--

We fix the first by making the data **longer** (combine columns shifting values into new rows).

We fix the second by making the data **wider** (combine rows by shifting values into new columns).

---

## Key ideas

- Tidy data has each column as a variable and each row as an observation.

- Tidy data is machine-readable/processable.

- Tidy data might not be particularly human-readable though!
