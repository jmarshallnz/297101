## Things we'll cover in the first 6 weeks

- Learning R/RStudio.

- Charting and visualisation with `ggplot2`.

- Reproducible analysis with `Quarto`.

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`.

- The importance of tidy data.

---

## Software

We use R via RStudio. https://www.r-project.org

R was developed in Auckland, by [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician%29), but now there are a cast of thousands.

It is programming language that is built with statistical analyses in mind.

You will **learn to write code** to clean data, produce charts, and build models.

We interact with R via the RStudio front-end: https://rstudio.com

Both are free, and you should install them on your computer. Instructions are here:

https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/help/usingrin297.122.html

## Getting help

- Use the stream forums to ask for help.

- Use the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Mzk7fUk) to ask for help.

- We encourage you to help your classmates on stream (or in workshops) as well.

- Try and help us (and your classmates) help you: e.g. if you have an R issue, copy your code and the error so we can spot the problem.

- Google is super useful! Include "R" or "RStudio" or maybe the name of the package "ggplot" or "dplyr" in your query.

- Turning off the AI stuff in google gives better results. Change your browser search engine to use:

    https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&udm=14

- Check the date of the google responses: older results might well be out of date.

## Use of LLMs

- Learning is hard. It is frustrating. It requires failure. It takes time and effort.

- LLMs offer a tempting shortcut. They're good at giving you code to answer questions!

- **BUT:** Those shortcuts mean you won't learn.

- Using them for "search" is OK, but the usual caveats apply.

    - How do you know what it is giving you is correct?
    - Do you have enough base knowledge to distinguish good results from bad?
    - Will you know if the 'answer' is just made up?

---

## Use of LLMs

- For coding, you only benefit from an LLM helper if it is only doing the bits you can
already do! i.e. they're great for boiler plate stuff as they give you more time for thinking.

- Don't let them do the "thinking" for you. They cannot do this!

- The AI use policy for the course is on the assessments page.

- You may be asked to explain your answer via zoom if you are suspected of presenting work that is not your own.

- We think the content in this course is worth learning. Hopefully you will to!

---

## Assessment

- 40% of the assessment is **weekly homework**

    - Low-stakes, around 4% per week. Adds up to a lot though!
    - Easy marks if you've done the weekly workshop. Hard/impossible if you haven't!
    - Keeps you on-track.
    - Sometimes it'll be a (short!) quiz, sometimes you hand something in (from or related to the workshop)

- Three assignments worth 20% each.

    - Use what you've learnt in the workshops
    - Has a component of "use something new we haven't specifically taught you"
    - Expected to take at least 10 hours. Start EARLY!

- General policy for lateness.

    - Extensions up to 7 days if requested well in advance.
    - Don't expect an extension if you haven't done anything yet!

---

## Workshops

- 2 hour workshop per week.

- **Super important!** This is where the magic (learning!) happens.

- You can work through them at your own pace.

- The homework assessment can be done after each workshop.

- In person sessions available at Manawatu or Albany.

- Distance/online students can ask teaching staff for help anytime (discord is best!)

---

## Lectures

- Pre-recorded videos (like this one!) each week.

- Watch whenever you want.

- Don't always have to watch the videos before doing the workshop, but you should watch and take notes from them all.

- One hour Q&A sessions each week at Manawatu and Albany. No new material discussed.
