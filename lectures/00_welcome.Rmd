## Who am I?

- I studied maths at university (this one!) and am Academic lead in Statistics.

- Interested in statistical modelling of disease.

- Two main areas: [spatio-temporal modelling](https://jmarshallnz.github.io/talks/nzsa2016), and [source attribution](https://jmarshallnz.github.io/talks/OHA2019).

## Things we'll cover in the first 6 weeks

- Learning R/RStudio.

- Charting and visualisation with `ggplot2`.

- Reproducible analysis with `rmarkdown`.

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`.

- The importance of tidy data.

---

## Software

We use R via RStudio. https://www.r-project.org

R was developed in Auckland, by [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician%29), but now there are a cast of thousands.

It is programming language that is built with statistical analyses in mind.

You will **learn to write code** to clean data, produce charts, and build models.

We interact with R via the RStudio front-end: https://rstudio.com

Both are free, and you should install them on your computer. Instructions are here:

https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/help/usingrin297.122.html

## Getting help

- Use the stream forums to ask for help.

- Use the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Mzk7fUk) to ask for help.

- We encourage you to help your classmates on stream (or in workshops) as well.

- Try and help us (and your classmates) help you: e.g. if you have an R issue, copy your code and the error so we can spot the problem.

- Google is super useful! Include "R" or "RStudio" or maybe the name of the package "ggplot" or "dplyr" in your query.

- Turning off the AI stuff in google gives better results. Change your browser search engine to use:

    https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&udm=14

- Check the date of the google responses: older results might well be out of date.

## Assessment

- 40% of the assessment is **weekly homework**

    - Low-stakes, around 4% per week. Adds up to a lot though!
    - Easy marks if you've done the weekly workshop. Hard/impossible if you haven't!
    - Keeps you on-track.
    - Sometimes it'll be a (short!) quiz, sometimes you hand something in (from or related to the workshop)

- Three assignments worth 20% each.

    - Use what you've learnt in the workshops
    - Has a component of "use something new we haven't specifically taught you"
    - Expected to take at least 10 hours. Start EARLY!

- General policy for lateness.

    - Extensions for weekly homework only in exceptional circumstances.
    - Extensions for assignments up to 7 days if requested well in advance.
    - Don't expect an extension if you haven't done anything yet!

---

## Workshops

- 2 hour workshop per week.

- **Super important!** This is where the magic (learning!) happens.

- You can work through them at your own pace.

- The homework assessment can be done after each workshop.

- In person sessions available at Manawatu or Albany.

- Distance/online students can ask teaching staff for help anytime (discord is best!)

---

## Lectures

- Pre-recorded videos (like this one!) each week.

- Watch whenever you want.

- Don't always have to watch the videos before doing the workshop, but you should watch and take notes from them all.
