## Pivoting longer

`covid4a` below suffers as a single variable (`cases`) is distributed across the two country columns. The country column names are values that the `country` variable takes, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
covid4a
```

--

We fix this by pivoting the two country columns into a new pair of variables. We need three things:

- The set of columns whose names are values rather than variables. This would be `Australia` and `New Zealand`.
- The name of the variable to move the column names into. In this case `country`.
- The name of the variable to move the column values into. In this case `cases`.

---

## Pivoting longer

`covid4a` is too wide, so let's take the `Australia` and `New Zealand` columns and pivot to a new set of columns `country` and `cases`.

```{r}
covid4a |>
  pivot_longer(c(Australia, `New Zealand`), names_to="country", values_to="cases")
```

We use quotes around the `country` and `cases` as they're not existing names.

This is now tidy: each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and all cells are values.

---

## Pivoting longer

`covid4a` is too wide, so let's take the `Australia` and `New Zealand` columns and pivot to a new set of columns `country` and `cases`.

    <img src="graphics/tidyr/covid4_tidy2.png" style="width: 360px;" align="top">
  </span>
</div>

This is now tidy: each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and all cells are values.

---

## Combining tables 4a and 4b

Once we have pivoted both tables to long format, we can join them with `left_join`
```{r}
tidy4a = covid4a |>
  pivot_longer(c(Australia, `New Zealand`), names_to = "country", values_to = "cases")
tidy4b = covid4b |>
  pivot_longer(c(Australia, `New Zealand`), names_to = "country", values_to = "tests")
tidy4a |> left_join(tidy4b)
```

---

## Pivoting wider

`covid2` is too long: an observation is a country in a month, but each observation is spread across
two rows (one for cases, one for tests).

.pull-left[
```{r}
covid2
```
]

--

.pull-right[
To tidy this up, we note that:

- The variable names are in the `type` column.

- The values for those variables are in the `count` column.

We use `pivot_wider()` for this.
]
---

## Pivoting wider

`covid2` is too long: we need to take the `type` and `count` columns and pivot so that the variables in `type` are separate columns.

```{r}
covid2 |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

Note that we don't need to quote the `type` and `count` as they are existing column names.

## Pivoting wider

`covid2` is too long: we need to take the `type` and `count` columns and pivot so that the variables in `type` are separate columns.

## Pivoting wider: Tables

Not all untidy data is bad!

Sometimes we **want** untidy data. What is untidy as far as a computer goes is not necessarily untidy for humans!

e.g. `covid4a` is probably quite a nice way of summarising the case data.

```{r}
covid4a
```

What might be better is to compute the percentage of cases by tests, to get a feel for whether testing was adequate at various stages.

---

## Pivoting wider: Tables

Using the tidy `covid1` data, we could compute rates and then pivot wider to a tabular display:

```{r}
covid1 |>
  mutate(rate = cases/tests * 100) |>
  select(-cases, -tests) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = rate) |>
  knitr::kable(format='html', digits=2)
```

The `kable()` function just gives us a slightly prettier looking table.

# Separating and uniting

---

## Separating

We've seen how to deal with `covid2` and `covid4a`, but what about `covid3`?

```{r}
covid3
```

--

The problem here is two variables in the same column. Observations are still per row, so all we need to do to fix this one
is seperate the `rate` variable up into it's components `cases` and `tests`.

We do this with the `separate()` function in `tidyr`.

---

## Separating

```{r}
covid3 |>
  separate(rate, into=c('cases', 'tests'))
```

By default `separate` will use anything that isn't alpha-numeric (i.e. a letter or number) to separate. You can specify a particular separator in the `sep` argument.

---

## Separating

```{r}
covid3 |>
  separate(rate, into=c('cases', 'tests'), convert=TRUE)
```

By default `separate` will use anything that isn't alpha-numeric (i.e. a letter or number) to separate. You can specify a particular separator in the `sep` argument.

Specifying `convert=TRUE` is helpful if you want to convert character strings into numbers.

---

## Uniting

The opposite of `separate()` is `unite()`. You don't tend to need this so often, but it's still useful. e.g. suppose
our data instead came like this:

```{r, message=FALSE}
covid5 <- read_csv("http://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/covid_au_nz5.csv")
covid5
```

In this case the single variable of time period (`month`) is spread over two columns (`start` and `end`).

---

## Uniting

The single variable of time period (`month`) is spread over two columns (`start` and `end`). We want to unite these into a single column separated by `-`:

```{r}
covid5 |>
  unite("month", start:end, sep="-")
```

# Missing values

---

## Missing values

Let's look at what happens when we look at year 1 and 2 students from West End School in Palmerston North:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
roll <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/schools/roll.csv")
```

```{r}
westend <- roll |> filter(School == "West End School (P North)",
                                         Level %in% c("Year 1", "Year 2"))
westend
```

---

## Missing values

Let's produce a table of these data by pivoting wider:

```{r}
westend |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Level, values_from = Students)
```

Where did that `NA` come from??

--

The `NA` is there because there was no entry in the data for MELAA students in Year 1 at West End School.

The value should be 0 (no students) but it was **implicitly missing**.

---

## Missing values

The `NA` was **implicitly missing** because there was no entry in the data for MELAA students in Year 1 at West End school.

By pivoting to wide, we've now made the missingness **explicit**. In this case, we know what the value should be, so when we produce the table, we could tell it via `values_fill`:

```{r}
westend |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Level, values_from = Students, values_fill = 0)
```

---

## Completing data

Another useful tool is `complete()`. You specify which columns you want and it will find all unique combinations, filling in where it was previously missing:

```{r}
westend |>
  complete(School, EthnicGroup, Level)
```

---

## Completing data

You can specify what the implicitly missing values should be via the `fill` argument:

```{r}
westend |>
  complete(School, EthnicGroup, Level, fill=list(Students=0))
```

---

## Key points

- Use `pivot_longer()` where you have variables distributed over multiple columns and multiple observations per row.

- Use `pivot_wider()` where you have multiple rows per observation and variable names encoded as a column.

- Use `separate()` where you have multiple variables in a single column.

- Use `unite()` to bring together multiple columns into a single variable.

- Look out for **implicit** missing observations. Use `complete()` to make them explicit.
