## Combining data through joins

It is common to receive data in several different spreadsheets.

e.g. if doing a study where samples are taken from animals across farms, you might have a samples spreadsheet, an animals spreadsheet, and a farms spreadsheet.

For final analyses on samples, however, you might want to assess animal or farm-level effects on outcomes at the sample level.

Thus, you'll need to combine the data from these spreadsheets together into a single `data.frame`.

In RStudio, we do this using **joins** in `dplyr`.

## Data sets

We'll use a couple of datasets from the Star Wars movies for this.

```{r, message=FALSE}
characters <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/starwars/sw_characters.csv")
characters
```

## Data sets

We'll use a couple of datasets from the Star Wars movies for this.

```{r, message=FALSE}
films <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/starwars/sw_films.csv")
films
```

## Joining with `dplyr`

There are two main types of join in dplyr: **mutating joins** and **filtering joins**.

- Mutating joins add new columns from the additional dataset.

- Filtering joins filter out existing columns based on information in the additional dataset.

For both, we need a set of 'primary' or 'key' columns: these are columns that share the same
information so we can merge the datasets together.

e.g. The `films` and `characters` datasets share the `name` column, so that will be our key.

---

## Mutating joins

There are four separate mutating joins:

- `left_join(x,y)` returns all rows in x, and all rows that match these in y. If y doesn't have a match, `NA` will be used.

- `right_join(x,y)` returns all rows in y and all rows that match these in x. If x doesn't have a match in y, `NA` will be used.

- `inner_join(x,y)` returns only rows in x and y that have a match.

- `full_join(x,y)` returns all rows in x and all rows in y. Anything in x or y that don't have a match will be filled with `NA`.

---

## Left join

`left_join(x, y)` returns:
- all rows in x
- all rows that match these in y.
- If y doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

Rows in y that do not match rows in x are dropped.
]

.left-code[
## Left join

`left_join(x, y)` returns:
- all rows in x
- all rows that match these in y.
- If y doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

If more than one row in y matches a row in x then you duplicate the x information.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/left-join-extra.gif)
]

---

`left_join(x, y)` returns all rows in x, and all rows that match these in y. If y doesn't have a match, `NA` will be used.

```{r}
characters |> left_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Right join

`right_join(x, y)` returns:
 - all rows in y
 - all rows that match these in x.
 - If x doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

Rows in x that don't have a match in y are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/right-join.gif)
]

---

`right_join()` returns all rows in the 'right' data set and anything that matches in the left.

```{r}
characters |> right_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Inner join

`inner_join(x, y)` returns:
 - only rows that match in x and y.
 - there is no `NA` from the join.

Rows that don't have a match in either x or y are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/inner-join.gif)
]

---

`inner_join()` returns only rows in both data sets. No `NA` from the join.

```{r}
characters |> inner_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Full join

`full_join(x, y)` returns:
 - all rows in both data sets.
 - anything that doesn't match gets `NA`.

No rows are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/full-join.gif)
]

---

`full_join()` returns all rows in both data sets. Anything that doesn't match gets `NA`.

```{r}
characters |> full_join(films)
```

---

## Mutating joins

The `left_join()` is the one I use the most.

Reason is you almost always start with the dataset that has the outcomes you want
in it, and are joining back to explanatory things.

---

## Filtering joins

The two filtering joins only return columns in x. They are:

- `semi_join(x,y)` returns rows in x with a match in y.

- `anti_join(x,y)` returns rows in x that don't have a match in y.

i.e. `semi_join` is for keeping things in, `anti_join` is to filter things out.

---

.left-code[
## Filtering joins

`semi_join(x, y)` returns:
 - rows in x that have a match in y.
 - only information from x.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/semi-join.gif)
]

---

## Filtering joins

`semi_join` will return the characters which are in one or more of our films.

```{r}
characters |> semi_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Filtering joins

`anti_join(x, y)` returns:
 - rows in x that don't match y.
 - only information from x.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/anti-join.gif)
]

---

## Filtering joins

`anti_join` will return the characters which aren't in any of our films.

```{r}
characters |> anti_join(films)
```

---

## Key points

- Think about which rows you want to keep in the final dataset when joining.

- If you start with the dataset that has all the rows you want in it already, and just want to add some columns from another dataset, use `left_join()`.

- The main case for `anti_join()` and `semi_join()` is a more efficient way to do filtering. It's likely you can do the same job with `filter()` anyway.
