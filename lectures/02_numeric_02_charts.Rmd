## Data today

We'll use the *E. coli* count data from rivers in the Horizons Region again today.

```{r, message=FALSE}
hrc <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/hrc/horizons_river_ecoli.csv")
hrc
```

These data are available from Land, Air, Water Aoteoroa, https://www.lawa.org.nz/download-data/

## Charts for numeric variables

There are lots of charts that summarise a single numeric variable well, but the three we'll look at are:

 - Histogram
 
 - Density plot
 
 - Boxplot

---

## Histogram

Divide the range of values into "bins" and then drop each value into the bin, counting as we go.

## Histogram
Divide the range of values into "bins" and then count the number of values that fall in each bin.

```{r hist1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_histogram( #<<
    mapping = aes(x = Value) #<<
    ) +#<<
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="hist1", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Histogram

The number of bins can change the plot shape, particularly on small data sets with rounded data, so it pays to experiment to make sure you are giving a fair representation.

```{r hist2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = Value),
    bins = 100 #<<
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```
100 bins is too many.

There is too much noise.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="hist2", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

## Histogram

The number of bins can change the plot shape, particularly on small data sets with rounded data, so it pays to experiment to make sure you are giving a fair representation.

```{r hist3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = Value),
    bins = 10 #<<
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```
10 bins possibly are too few.

Some of the signal is lost.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="hist3", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

## Density

Drop a blob of jelly (**kernel**) where each value is. Where values are close (**density**) the jelly overlaps and builds up.

## Density

Drop a blob of jelly (**kernel**) where each value is on the x-axis.

Where values are close (**density**) the jelly overlaps and builds up.

```{r dens1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_density( #<<
    mapping = aes(x = Value) #<<
    ) + #<<
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```

A smoothed version of a histogram.

The scale on the y-axis is such that the area
under the curve is 1.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="dens1", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Density

A choice to make is the **bandwidth** which is basically how wide the jelly blob is.

You can adjust the default with the `adjust` multiplier.

```{r dens2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(x = Value),
    adjust=0.5 #<<
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```

A value less than 1 reduces bandwidth and you get more noise.

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="dens2", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

.left-code[
## Density

A choice to make is the **bandwidth** which is basically how wide the jelly blob is.

You can adjust the default with the `adjust` multiplier.

```{r dens3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hrc) +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(x = Value),
    adjust=2 #<<
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
    )
```
A value larger than one increases bandwidth and you potentially lose signal.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="dens3", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Boxplot

A boxplot reduces the data down to the **5 number summary**: The minimum, maximum, median, lower quartile and upper quartile.

```{r boxplot1, fig.dim=c(7,2), fig.retina=3}
ggplot(hrc) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=Value)) + scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_comma())
```

In addition, any observations beyond a certain limit (1.5 box lengths away from the ends of the box) are marked individually as extreme observations.

---

## Boxplot: Skewness

We can infer some shape details from the boxplot by noting that the quartiles and median divide the data into quarters.

So a longer 'tail' at one end coupled with the box not being balanced suggests that the data are not symmetric.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(7,1.5), fig.retina=3}
ggplot(hrc) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=Value)) + scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  theme_void() + labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)
```

These data would be described as **mostly** symmetric: the 'tail' on the right is longer due to the extreme values, but without them we'd call it symmetric.

We worry about (and comment on) lack of symmetry when it is really clear. If it's not really clear, no need to worry too much about it!

# Comparing across groups

## Comparing across groups

- For histograms and density charts the `fill` or `col` aesthetics can be used to separate groups.

- The `position` argument is useful for refining how multiple groups are placed for a histogram.

- Set `alpha` to make filled densities partially transparent.

- Boxplots can place groups next to each other using the `y` aesthetic.

- With many groups, switching the numeric variable to `y` works better.

- Generally, boxplots are better when you have many groups.

.left-code[
## Histogram by group

```{r comp1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      fill = species #<<
      ),
    bins=12
    )
```

By default the histogram will **stack** bars.

This makes it hard to compare groups as the histograms don't all start at 0.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp1", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Histogram by group

```{r comp2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      fill = species
      ),
    bins=12,
    position = "dodge" #<<
    )
```

Using `dodge` for `position` will put the bars
side by side.

This breaks up the histogram so it still isn't all
that easy to read.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp2", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Histogram by group

```{r comp3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      fill = species
      ),
    bins=12,
    position = "identity", #<<
    alpha = 0.5 #<<
    )
```

Using `identity` for `position` will put the bars over the top of each other.

You need to add some transparency to see the ones underneath.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp3", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]


---

.left-code[
## Density by group

```{r comp4, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      col = species #<<
      ),
    )
```

Using `col` by group works.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp4", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Density by group

```{r comp5, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      fill = species #<<
      ),
    alpha = 0.7 #<<
    )
```

`fill` by group maybe looks better?

Add some transparency by setting `alpha`.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp5", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Boxplots by group

```{r comp6, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      fill = species #<<
      )
    )
```

Setting `fill` will separate the groups out.

But the y-axis doesn't make sense.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp6", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Boxplots by group

```{r comp7, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = species #<<
      )
    )
```

Setting `y` instead works better.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp7", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Boxplots by group

```{r comp8, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = species, #<<
      y = flipper_length_mm #<<
      )
    )
```

Having groups on `x` and the measure on `y` works
better for many groups.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp8", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Boxplots by group

```{r comp9, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = species,
      y = flipper_length_mm,
      col = species #<<
      )
    )
```
Having groups on `x` and the measure on `y` works
better for many groups.

You can always colour them too `r emo::ji("smile")`
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp9", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Boxplots by group

```{r comp10, eval=FALSE}
manawatu <-
  filter(hrc,
    str_detect(Site, "manawatu")
    )
ggplot(data = manawatu) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = SiteID,
      y = Value,
      fill = SiteID
      )
    ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +
  guides(fill = 'none')
```

With lots of groups a boxplot is best.
]
.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="comp10", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

## Key ideas

- Summarise **center**, **spread** and **shape**.

- Densities and histograms are great when we have lots of data.

- Use colour to differentiate different groups.

- Boxplots are best for comparing across many groups.
