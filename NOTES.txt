Notes for 2024 297101

Workshops: 2 hours a week, single session. Can probably be a little shorter
than the ones we had in 161.122 to stretch out...

Workshop 1: Intro to R and ggplot. Scatter plot? Jitter? Smoother?

Something other than the earthquake data I think?

Or use the EQ data from lab 2+3 first for scatterplot, smoother, jitter, colours.

Assessment: Some questions on ggplot (set vs map, ask what plot code is doing,
jitter/alpha?)

Workshop 2: Histogram, density, boxplot.

Use EQ data from lab 3, with categorisation of depth perhaps?

Assessment: Questions on density/histogram bins, interpret of boxplot?

Workshop 3: Quarto, log transforms?

Need some new data for log transforms. Maybe some covid data?

Assessment: Hand in rendered quarto file containing analysis of new data set?

Workshop 4: Dplyr (A5+A6)

Assessment: Answer questions from school data? Cricket ODI questions?

Workshop 5: Dplyr + ggplot extras (A7+A8)

Assessment: Reproduce a graph? Make a graph bad?

ASSIGNMENT 1

Workshop 6: Visual inference in the context of regression, difference in means,
(Donkey data?), Intro to the CLT and Normal distribution?




QMD rather than RMD?

Lectures: Video only, so can be shorter, e.g. two 30-40 minute a week?

Tutorials: Could include maybe a "story" each week? Could also just do drop-in session?
